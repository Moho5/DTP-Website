                <h1>Jabir Ibn Haiyan
                    (Died 803 C.E.)</h1>
                <p class="black-color-text">Jabir Ibn Hayyan, also known as Geber, was a prominent figure in the Middle Ages and is often 
                    referred to as the father of chemistry. He was born to a druggist (Attar) and practiced medicine and alchemy in 
                    Kufa around 776 C.E. Jabir's major contribution to the field of chemistry was the introduction of experimental investigation
                    into alchemy, transforming it into what we now recognize as modern chemistry. He was known for his pioneering 
                    work in various scientific techniques, including crystallization, distillation, calcination, sublimation, and 
                    evaporation.  One of Jabir's practical achievements was the discovery and preparation of mineral and other acids in his alembic (Anbique). He made significant 
                    contributions to applied chemical processes, such as metal preparation, steel development, dyeing, tanning, 
                    varnishing, glass-making, rust prevention, and more. He emphasized experimentation and accuracy in his work,
                    classifying substances into three categories: spirits, metals, and compounds that can be converted into powders. 
                    This classification laid the groundwork for later distinctions between metals, non-metals, and volatile 
                    substances. Some of his books, including "Kitab-al-Kimya" and "Kitab al-Sab'een," were 
                    translated into Latin and various European languages, influencing the evolution of modern chemistry.

                <h1>Mohammad Bin Musa
                    (Died 840 C.E.)</h1>
                    <p class="black-color-text">Abu Abdullah Muhammad Ibn Musa al-Khawarizmi, born around 780 in Khwarizm (modern Khiva), 
                        was a mathematician and astronomer who made significant contributions to mathematics. His book 
                        "Hisab Al-Jabr wal Mugabalah" (Book of Calculations, Restoration, and Reduction) laid the foundation for 
                        algebra, with the term "algebra" derived from the title of his work. He also authored "Kitab Surat-Al-Ard," 
                        a significant geography text with maps, and developed trigonometric tables containing sine functions. 
                        Al-Khawarizmi introduced the Indian numeral system, including zero, and developed the decimal system. 
                        His work influenced European mathematics for centuries, and his contributions to algebra and arithmetic 
                        remain central to the field.

                            (Died 1037 C.E.)</h1>
                        <p class="black-color-text">JAbu Ali al-Husayn ibn Abd Allah ibn Sina, commonly known as Avicenna, was a prominent
                            Persian polymath born around 980 in Afshana, near Bukhara, and he passed away in 1037. Ibn Sina's most 
                            renowned work, "Kitab al-Qanun fi al-Tibb" (The Canon of Medicine), became a seminal medical text in 
                            both the Islamic and European worlds for centuries. In this comprehensive medical encyclopedia, he 
                            outlined principles of medicine, diagnosis, and therapeutics. Additionally, his philosophical masterpiece
                            "Kitab al-Shifa" (The Book of Healing) explored various branches of knowledge, including philosophy, 
                            ethics, and logic. Ibn Sina's contributions extended to mathematics, astronomy, and chemistry, making 
                            him a revered figure in the history of science and a profound influence on both Islamic and Western 
                            intellectual traditions. His pioneering work in various fields continues to be celebrated today.

                    <h1>Ibn Al-Haitham
                        (Died 1040 C.E.)</h1>
                    <p class="black-color-text">Abu Ali al-Hasan ibn al-Hasan ibn al-Haytham, commonly known as Alhazen, 
                        was a brilliant Arab polymath born around 965 in Basra, Iraq, and he passed away around 1040 in 
                        Cairo. Ibn al-Haytham made groundbreaking contributions to optics, mathematics, and the scientific method. 
                        His monumental work "Kitab al-Manazir" (Book of Optics) revolutionized the understanding of vision and 
                        light, laying the foundation for modern optics. In this treatise, he explored the behavior of light and 
                        its reflection and refraction, emphasizing empirical observations and experimentation. His insights into 
                        the camera obscura influenced the development of photography centuries later. Ibn al-Haytham also contributed
                        to the fields of mathematics and astronomy, advancing the understanding of mathematical principles and 
                        celestial observations. His rigorous approach to scientific inquiry and emphasis on experimentation earned 
                        him the title "the father of the scientific method." Ibn al-Haytham's enduring legacy continues to inspire 
                        scientists and scholars worldwide, with his work recognized as a cornerstone of the scientific revolution.

                <h1>Ibn Al-Nafis
                    (Died 1288 C.E.)</h1>
                <p class="black-color-text">Ismail ibn Abi al-Hussein ibn Ishaq ibn al-Nafis, commonly known as Ibn al-Nafis, 
                    was a distinguished Arab physician and polymath born in 1213 in Damascus, Syria, and he passed away
                    in Cairo around 1288. His significant contribution to the field of medicine can be attributed to his
                    groundbreaking work on the circulatory system, which preceded similar discoveries by Western scholars. 
                    Ibn al-Nafis's most famous work, "Kitab al-Mujiz" (The Book of the Aid), provided a detailed description 
                    of pulmonary circulation, recognizing the role of the lungs in oxygenating blood and the distinction between 
                    arterial and venous blood. This innovative insight significantly advanced the understanding of human physiology. 
                    While his work on the circulatory system is his most celebrated achievement, Ibn al-Nafis was also a prominent 
                    physician and scholar in other fields, contributing to various aspects of medicine and anatomy. His pioneering 
                    work in the realm of human physiology has solidified his place as a trailblazer in the history of medicine, with 
                    his contributions continuing to be recognized and celebrated by medical professionals and scholars worldwide.
